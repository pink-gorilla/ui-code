; Returns an {left, top, bottom} object containing the coordinates of the cursor 
; position. If mode is "local", they will be relative to the top-left corner of
; the editable document. If it is "page" or not given, they are relative to the 
; top-left corner of the page. If mode is "window", the coordinates are relative 
; to the top-left corner of the currently visible (scrolled) window. where can be
; a boolean indicating whether you want the start (true) or the end (false) of the
; selection, or, if a {line, ch} object is given, it specifies the precise position
; at which you want to measure.
